# Bike_Sharing_Case_Study
A Linear Regression Model Case Study to increase the Bike Rental Service of an organization.
This project is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
The business goal here is that we are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
